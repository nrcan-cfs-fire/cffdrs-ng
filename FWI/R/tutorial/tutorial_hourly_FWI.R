#### Hourly Fire Weather Index (FWI) Tutorial ####
# February 2025 (Last updated September 2025)
#
# This script was designed to go with a tutorial on the NG-CFFDRS website to inform
# users how to use scripts associated with FWI2025. Follow along with the
# 'Hourly FWI Tutorial - R' page on the NG-CFFDRS website:
# https://cffdrs.github.io/website_en/tutorials/Hourly_FWI_R
# This tutorial will demonstrate how to generate FWI2025 outputs based on an
# input from a .csv. The method will differ if using another source file type or
# if integrating code into existing fire management systems. This tutorial
# assumes the user has a working level knowledge of R.

### Load libraries ###
# Run install.packages() to install any you are missing
library(lubridate)
library(data.table)

### Load functions and data ###
# If the working directory is different from where you saved the FWI2025 scripts,
# change the working directory with setwd() to that folder.

# Load the files containing the variables and functions to calculate FWI2025.
source("NG_FWI.r")
source("util.r")
source("daily_summaries.r")

# Load the input weather station data file
# Specify the file path if PRF2007_hourly_wx.csv is not in the working directory
data <- read.csv("PRF2007_hourly_wx.csv")

# Print the column names, data should contain 12 columns
names(data)
# [1] "id"       "lat"      "long"     "timezone" "yr"       "mon"
# [7] "day"      "hr"       "temp"     "rh"       "ws"       "prec"

# Previously, the timezone (UTC offset) was a function parameter and calculated from
# latitude and longitude. Now it is a data frame column and provided. See the
# appendix of this tutorial for extra information on how to calculate the timezone,
# along with the extra information required about the dataset.

### Run FWI2025 ###
# hFWI() is the function that calculates hourly FWI codes in FWI2025. It can
# handle multiple stations and years/fire seasons (not shown in this tutorial).
# Default FWI start-up code values are: ffmc_old = 85, dmc_old = 6, dc_old = 15
data_fwi <- hFWI(data)

# Output is a data.frame (matching input class), with FWI calculations appended
# after the input columns. Save the output as a .csv file (overrides any preexisting
# file).
write.csv(data_fwi, "PRF2007_hourly_FWI.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Print the last two rows of the standard moisture codes and fire behaviour indices.
standard_components <- c("ffmc", "dmc", "dc", "isi", "bui", "fwi")
tail(data_fwi[standard_components], 2)
#         ffmc    dmc       dc    isi    bui    fwi
# 2622 80.2669 3.0924 219.5169 1.6423 5.9745 0.7650
# 2623 82.1759 3.3503 220.0533 2.1462 6.4550 1.2023

# Print a simple summary of the standard FWI components.
summary(data_fwi[standard_components])

### Calculate daily summaries ###
# Calculate outputs like peak burn time and number of hours of spread potential.
report <- generate_daily_summaries(data_fwi)

# Print a simple summary of the daily report.
daily_components <- c("peak_hr", "duration", "isi_smooth", "dsr")
summary(report[daily_components])
#    peak_hr         duration        isi_smooth          dsr

# From here, the outputs can be converted to any datatype for further analysis or
# plotted for visualization.

### Appendix: timezone ###
# This section will cover how to calculate a timezone based on a location (latitude
# and longitude) and date. Note that this is not necessarily a substitute for
# actual information about the time used in a dataset. The CFFDRS Weather Guide
# specifies to collect data by local standard time, which is different in many
# places due to the shift to daylight time in summer months (daylight savings).

# The 'lutz' library has functions to get the timezone of the weather station
# based on latitude and longitude.
library(lutz)

# First, make a dataframe of stations with unique ID, latitude, and longitude.
stations <- unique(data[c("id", "lat", "long")])
# Print the unique station IDs and coordinates. For this dataset the only station
# is at Petawawa Research Forest (PRF).
stations
#    id    lat    long
# 1 PRF 45.996 -77.427

# Find the timezone based on latitude and longitude, this can take some time.
# You may need to download the package 'sf' for method = "accurate".
tz_loc <- tz_lookup_coords(stations$lat, stations$long, method = "accurate")
# Print the timezone location. PRF is equivalent to "America/Toronto".
tz_loc
# [1] "America/Toronto"

# The UTC offset can then be determined from the timezone location.
utc <- tz_offset("2007-05-10", tz_loc)[[5]]
# Print the UTC offset
utc

# Since May 10, 2007 is during daylight savings the UTC offset calculated above
# corresponds to Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), UTC-4. This matches the timezone
# column provided since this data was collected using EDT. For Eastern Standard Time
# (EST), the UTC offset would be UTC-5.
